<p class="p1">Programming refers to a technological process for telling a computer which tasks to perform in order to solve problems. At its most basic, programming tells a computer what to do. First, a programmer writes code—a set of letters, numbers, and other characters. Next, a compiler converts each line of code into a language a computer can understand. Then, the computer scans the code and executes it, thereby performing a task or series of tasks. Tasks might include displaying an image on a webpage or changing the font of a section of text.

   <p class="p1">And there’s a lot of countries take careto teach programming as much as it can like egypt . egypt provides many initiatives to encourage young people to study programming and from these initiatives (Egypt’s digital clubs initiative )</p>
   <p class="p1">Digital Egypt Cubs Initiative (DECI) was launched by the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT) in May 2022. DECI is a program offered free to top-performing students, from the first year of preparatory school to the second year of secondary school, in Egyptian schools nationwide.</p>
   <p class="p1">The idea behind DECI is to equip youngsters with IT skills, helping create young talents with proven competence in emerging technologies and fulfilling the national vision of keeping up with the sciences and requirements of tomorrow’s labor market.</p>
